# Overview
This repository is meant to host a few sample applications that will leverage AWS serverless framework. It is only meant to be for my knowledge and understanding of these services

Since the code here will be using AWS services, you will obviously need an AWS account. All the services here will be created via Terraform for easy management and the terraform code can be found in the [terraform](./terraform) directory
